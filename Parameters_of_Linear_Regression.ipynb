    "Linear Regression is the most basic yet powerful statistical method in forecasting . Even though in real life not much of the informations are linearly related , yet the use of this technique can't be over looked.It's definitely very easy to calculate the parameters of linear regression using tools and packages like excel and sklearn. However at times you may want to try out to code it by yourself to understand the method of finding the parameters by your own. Trust me it's fun and interesting as well .The Professors normally encourage you to code it by yorself and not use any package directly . \n",
